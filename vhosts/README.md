# Example vhosts files for an SSL only website

These vhosts files will setup a domain which will redirect any visitor to the SSL configured service.  

The SSL directives at the bottom of the page result in the best total score for an Apache 2.22 server with OpenSSL version 1.01 installed on ssllabs.com.

If anyone can see any way to improve these files, I'd appreciate the feedback.
